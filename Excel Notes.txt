Coefficient of Correlation (R) -1 to +1
Coefficient of Determination (R square) 0 to +1

R indicates whether the correlation is +ve , -ve or no correlation between two variables X & Y.

R square indicates the strength of the relationship between two numeric variables X & Y. Value close to 1 is always preferred.

Prediction can be done for numeric or categorical variable. 
Numeric prediction examples - Sales, Profit, Quantity etc.
Categorical prediction examples - employee leaving or not, customer buying credit card or not 

Variable on X axis is called Independent variable while variable on Y axis is called Dependent or Response variable. Prediction is always done for Dependent variable using Independent variable values.
This prediction is performed using Line Equation in the form of Y = mX + C where m is slope (coefficient) and C is intercept.

Line equation
Margin = (1.2729 * Profit) 
+ 36.687

Using this equation, calculate margin for profit = 250.
