Tableau -

Measures & Dimensions

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) & Pre-processing

Only maths function that is possible on dimensions is COUNT

No. of columns = 24
No. of rows = 51290

5 columns - Measures (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping cost)
19 columns - Dimensions

Visualization - combination of measures & dimensions
e.g. Sales by State, Profit by Category, Quantity by Segment etc.

Dimensions - Find out unique values from Categorical dimensions

Measures - Find out which measures use fraction values (float) and which not (integer)

Workbook

Three major components of Tableau -
1. Worksheet
2. Dashboard
3. Story

How to join multiple tables in Tableau -

Before 2020 - JOIN
Data is joined from tables before visualization
Types of Joins - 
1. Equi join (Inner)
2. Left outer
3. Right outer
4. Full outer

After 2020 - Relationship
Data is joined only after visualization starts

Dimensions are displayed in BLUE color while measures are displayed in GREEN color.

Three types of sorting on columns -
1. Ascending
2. Descending
3. Default (Data source)

Tableau visualization page is divided into 9 sections -
1. Dimensions
2. Measures
3. Pages
4. Filter
5. Marks
6. Column
7. Row
8. Canvas
9. Show Me


There are 4 types of layout -
1. Standard
2. Fit width
3. Fit height
4. Entire view

Profit by Region & Ship Mode

Three dimensional Analysis
1. Shipping Cost by Market, Country & Order Priority
2. Sales by Market, Country & Segment
3. Quantity by Market, Country & Ship Mode
4. Profit by Market, Country & Category

COUNT vs COUNTD

Highlight all countries having no. of cities 100 or above.

Find out no. of products (product ID field) for region and Category using Highlight table.

Colors based on dimension 
is called Discrete Colors

Colors based on measures
is called Continuous Colors

Profit % by Category
Quantity % by Segment

Three types of bar chart -
1. Normal
2. Side by side - when no. of values in both dimensions are fewer then this chart is suitable
Total bars created = no. of values in dimension 1 * no. of values in dimension 2

3. Stacked bar - when no. of values in either dimension are high then use that dimension to create bar chart first and then use second dimension
e.g. Sub-category has 17 values & Segment has 3 values so start bar chart with Sub-category and then use Segment
Type of chart - 100% stacked bar chart to show % values on the bar


Quantity by Sub-category (Bar chart)
Shipping cost by Sub-category (Bar chart)
Quantity by Region (Bar chart)
Shipping cost by Region (Bar chart)
Sales by Region (Bar chart)
Profit by Sub-category (Bar chart)

Using bar chart, identify
sub-categories having quantity
greater than 10000.

Using bar chart, identify
sub-categories having 
Shipping cost 
greater than 100000.

Using bar chart, identify
regions having quantity
less than 15000.

Using bar chart, identify
regions having 
Shipping cost 
less than 50000.

Side by Side charts -

1. Sales by Segment & Order Priority (Side by Side)
2. Sales by Order Priority & Ship Mode (Side by Side)
3. Profit by Segment & Category (Side by Side)
4. Quantity by Ship Mode & Segment (Side by Side)
5. Shipping cost by Ship Mode & Category (Side by Side)
6. Profit by Order Priority & Ship Mode (Side by Side)

100% Stacked bar chart -
1. Sales % by Segment & Order Priority (Stacked bar)
2. Sales % by Order Priority & Ship Mode (Stacked bar)
3. Profit % by Sub-category & Segment (Stacked bar)
4. Profit % by Region & Segment (Stacked bar)
5. Profit % by Region & Category (Stacked bar)
6. Profit % by Sub-category & Ship Mode (Stacked bar)

Line charts - 

1. Discrete line (Blue)
2. Continuous line (Green)

Year
Quarter
Month
Week
Day

Always drag date field on column

Monthly no. of products 
(Discrete line) 

Put Ship Mode on Color

Area chart is a variation
of line chart except the
shading below the line.




Highlight all values having sales > 300k

Sales by Sub-category & Ship Mode (Heatmap)
Quantity by Region & Category (Heatmap)
Profit by Region & Category (Heatmap)
Profit by Region & Order Priority (Heatmap)

Scatter plot techniques -

1. Without aggregation
Sales vs Profit Scatter plot 
by Segment
Sales vs Profit Scatter plot 
by Order Priority


2. With aggregation

Histogram - 
Bin size = 500
Bin 1 = 0 to 499
There are 44538 (86%) records
in the database having
sales value between 0 to 499

Bin 2 = 500 to 999
There are 4126 (8%) records
in the database having
sales value between 500 to 999
